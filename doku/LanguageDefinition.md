# Structural:

* Given there exists a class <classname> [that takes one parameter].
* Given there exists a class <classname>.
* Given there exists an object <concreteObjectName> [of the type <className>].
* Given there exists a variable <variableName> in the object/class <concreteInstanceName/className>. 
* Given there exists a procedure <procedureName> [for the class/object <className/concreteInstanceName>].
* Given that the object <concreteObjectName> is assigned to variable <variableName> [in the object <concreteInstanceName>].

# Behavioral:

* When the procedure <procedureName> [of the object <concreteInstanceName>] [with the parmeter <parameter>] is called, then <result> is returned.
* When the procedure <procedureName> [of the object <concreteInstanceName> is called] [with the parmeter <parameter>], then the procedure <procedureName2> [of the object <concreteInstanceName2> is called] is called.
* When the procedure <procedureName> [of the object <concreteInstanceName> is called] [with the parmeter <parameter>], the program does not terminate.
* When the procedure <procedureName> [of the object <concreteInstanceName>] is called, then <ListOfCharacters> is displayed on the command line.
