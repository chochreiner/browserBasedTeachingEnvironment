# Description:
# In this example you will implement the class *Stack*, that provides the methods *push*, *pull* and *size*, whereas push returns the pushed element, pull returns the last pushed element and sizes returns the amount of items on the stack.

# Task 1:
# Define the class *Stack* and implement the methods *push*, *pull* and *size*.

# Given there exists a class Stack.
# Given there exists a procedure push for the class Stack.
# Given there exists a procedure pull for the class Stack.
# Given there exists a procedure size for the class Stack.


# Task 2:
# Create a instance of *Stack* named *stack* and push the three characters *a*, *b*, *c* onto the stack.

# When the procedure size of the instance stack is called, then 3 is returned.
# When the procedure pop of the instance stack is called, then c is returned.
# When the procedure pop of the instance stack is called, then b is returned.
# When the procedure size of the instance stack is called, then 1 is returned.
# When the parametrized-procedure push of the instance stack with the parameter d is called, then d is returned.
