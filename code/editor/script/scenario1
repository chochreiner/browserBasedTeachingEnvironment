# Description:
#In this example you will create objects and procedures and you will execute them.

#Task 1:
#Define the objects named *objectA* and *objectB*.

# Given there exists an object objectA.
# Given there exists an object objectB.

#Task 2:
#Define the instance-variables *refA* for *objectB* and *refB* for *objectA* and assign *objectA* to *refA* and *objectB* to *refB*.


# Given there exists a variable refB in the object objectA.
# Given there exists a variable refA*in the object objectB.

#Task 3:
#Define the procedures *foo* and *bar*; *foo* is defined for *objectA* and calls the procedure *bar* that is defined for *objectB*.
#The procedure bar should return the string *foobar*.


# Given there exists a procedure foo for the object objectA.
# Given there exists a procedure bar for the object objectB.

#Task 4:
#Execute the procedure foo of objectA and store the returnvalue to the variable result.


# When the procedure foo of the object objectA is called then foobar is returned.
# When the procedure foo of the object objectA is called, then the procedure bar is called.
